There are a variety of options to get your members added into your organization. This page will explain the three most common ways to get your organization rostered. 

# Adding Members by Roster Uploading
If you have access to a roster with names and phone numbers of your membership, we can automatically add all your members to your organization.

### Step 1. Format your organization roster into a spreadsheet in the following format 

|Full Name | Phone Number |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Jack Doe | 5551234567 |
| Jane Doe | 5559876543 |

### Step 2. Email your roster to help@doorlist.app
Please include the name of the organization, the name and phone number of the primary admin, and the name of the school.
