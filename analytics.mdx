## Analytics

You can find Analytics for any event in the event page.

1. **Attendance Rate:** The percentage of people who from your guest list who attended your event
2. **Check-In Methods:** A breakdown of how attendees checked into the event
3. **Scan Attempts:** A breakdown of how people attempted to scan into your event
4. **Total Invites:** A breakdown of the total invites and a summary of all RSVPs

<Warning>
  Attendees must check-in via scan, location-based check-in, website attendance, or manual check-in to be officially marked "Attended"
</Warning>

**Export Event Report:** Hosts can export their event report in .xlsx format, which includes scan history, check-in time, invite method, and many more granular details from the Analytics page

## Attendance

Hosts can access individual attendance by tapping "Guests" on the event page. You can then filter by "Attended" or "Did not Attend"

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Use Location-Based Check-In or Website Attendance for meetings where you want to track attendance without wanting to use a scanner. Learn more about [Check-In Options](https://docs.doorlist.app/edit-event) (under advanced settings)
