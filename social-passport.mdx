Each user has a unique, dynamic QR code. Because of the dynamic nature of the QR code, it cannot be screenshotted, shared, or replicated.

Your QR code is your pass to ALL DoorList events where you are on the guest list. By tapping on the QR code you can expand your passport to see all of the stamps you have earned across your DoorList events.
