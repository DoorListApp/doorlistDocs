**Connections:** Connections are created by sharing a connection request with the admin of another organization. Connected groups may invite each other to any subsequent events.

**Verification:** Groups may apply for verification after creating a group or by emailing [help@doorlist.app](mailto:help@doorlist.app). Verification is designed for social groups that frequently need to invite other groups. Verified groups at a campus can invite each other to their events.

## How to create a connection:

1. Navigate to the organization admin page.

2. Tap '+' on the right hand side next to 'Add Members', then tap 'Add Connections'.

3. Send the connection link to the desired connections. The person receiving this link must be an admin of that organization.

4. Once the connection is accepted, the connected organization will be listed for your organization.

## How do I invite connected/verified organizations?

After you create an event, open up the 'Invite Groups' page. From there, verified groups can invite other verified groups, and connected groups can view all of their connections to invite to their events
