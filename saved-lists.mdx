## What are Saved Lists?

Saved Lists allow for groups to quickly add a list of people to an event who aren't in their or another organization.

Examples of Saved Lists might include:

- Rush list
- Career interests
- Social members
- Alumni
- Class year

Saved Lists are private to the admins of your group and those in Saved Lists will not be alerted that they are in one. You can add Saved Lists to your event lists the same way you would add other organizations. When your organization is added to an event list, your Saved Lists will NOT be added.

## How to create a Saved List and add members:

1. From the group admin page, tap the "..." in the top right
2. Tap Saved Lists
3. Tap \+ in the top right and name your Saved List
4. Tap on the Saved List to add Friends, Contacts, and more
   1. Or provide a roster to [help@doorlist.app](mailto:help@doorlist.app) (see the adding members page for roster formatting) please include your organization name and subgroup name
