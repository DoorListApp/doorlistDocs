## What are Saved Lists?

Saved Lists allow for groups to quickly add a list of people to an event who aren't in a group.

Examples of subgroups might include:

- Rush list
- Career interests
- Social members
- Alumni
- Class year

Saved Lists are private to the admins of your organization and those in Saved Lists will not be alerted that they are in one. You can add Saved Lists to your event lists the same way you would add other organizations. When your organization is added to an event list, your Saved Lists will NOT be added.
